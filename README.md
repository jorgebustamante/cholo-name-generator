Character names are all from Homies™ character list, official Homies™ website unfortunately is not hosted online as of 2019.  
As a nerd I've been very obsessed with digital anthropology, particularly that concerning mexican-american presence on the internet historically.  
In net media in the early 2000s-- Mexican american art held larger estate in representation, this could be seen in digital art posted and shared in early myspace years and forums prior to the centralization of social media.  
This was created as an homage and as a way to preserve that period of time where cholo media had greater presence online.
